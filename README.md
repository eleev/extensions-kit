# ios-extensions
ðŸŽ‰ Collection of Swift iOS-related extensions for various use cases. Many of the extension works on macOS, tvOS and watchOS. Basically it's a collection of extensions that I started implementing for own needs. There are about `30` different extensions. Feel free to suggest something new and amazing. 

# List of extensions
All the extensions are split into separete `groups` each of which represents a separete `SDK framework`.

# Contributing 
- There is just one main rule for contributors - **please include your extensions for separete files**. It's important since such extension can be more easily referenced and reused.
- The other `soft` rule is - please include `unit` tests with your extensions.
